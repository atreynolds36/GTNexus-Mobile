# About

Applications built on the GTNexus platform allow developers
to enhance and extend the core GT Nexus process and integrate 
with their existing systems in real time using an application 
platform and an open data API. This repository provides an example
of an application that is deployable to any mobile device and 
displays the power of the AppXpress API. The AppXpress API allows
flexibility and accessibility to the vast data stored on the GTNexus
platform through an easy to use RESTful service.
